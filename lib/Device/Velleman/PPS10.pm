=head1 NAME

Device::Velleman::PPS10 - Read data from Velleman PPS10 oscilloscope

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Device::Velleman::PPS10;
    my $pps10 = Device::Velleman::PPS10->new;

    while (1) {
        # Read data from serial port and append to buffer in $pps10 object.
        $pps10->read;

        # Get 0 or more packets that may exist in buffer.
        while (my $packet = $pps10->get_next_packet) {
            # Do stuff with packet of a single frame of the signal trace.
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Velleman PPS10 oscilloscope sends each frame of the signal
displayed on its LCD screen as a series of packets over the serial
port. Each packet contains 256 voltage samples, which if traced
graphically, replicates the signal the LCD screen. The data in the
packet is more detailed than can be drawn on the 128x64 LCD screen.

Device::Velleman::PPS10 allows for reading of the raw data from the
serial port and parses for packets containing the frames. Currently,
the module only uses the packet type (BA) containing a complete frame
of a signal trace. The scope sends two other packet types (BR and BS),
which contain 1 or just a few samples.

This module relies on Device::SerialPort. The user may need to handle
permission issues when reading from the serial port device on their
system.

This module has not been tested on a Win32 system.

=head2 The Raw Data

The data sent by the oscilloscope over the serial device is
binary. There are three packet types and each begins with a delimiter
of 2 to 4 byte values. The delimiter is then followed by 6 header
values containing oscilloscope settings such as volts/division. This
version of the module only processes the BA type packets. These
packets contain 256 sample values following the headers. One byte per
sample.

=head2 Parsed Packet Data Structure

The final product of parsing the raw data from the serial device is a
hash containing the unscaled and scaled voltage samples, and
oscilloscope setting values contained in each packet. The unscaled
sample values of the signal are scaled to actual voltage values given
the display settings reported in the packet.

    $packet = {
        packet_type      => 'BA' | 'BR' | 'BS',
        raw_packet       => <binary data>, # packet data from serial port to be parsed
        processed_packet => $packet,       # actual raw packet that was parsed
        header           => [ ... ],       # array of header values in decimal
        time_per_div     => '0.002',       # time between division marks on screen
        time_per_point   => '0.0002',      # time between each sample point
        volts_per_div    => '0.01',        # volts between division marks on screen
        volts_per_point  => '0.0003125',   # volts between each sample point
        volts_acdc       => 'ac' | 'dc',
        volts_10x        => 0 | 1,
        time             => [ ... ],       # sample counts 0 .. 255
        trace            => [ ... ],       # the sample values in decimal
        x_max            => 0.0512',       # end of x-axis in seconds from 0
        y_max            => 0.04',         # height of y-axis in volts above the 0V baseline
        time_scaled      => [ ... ],       # x-axis values in seconds
        trace_scaled     => [ ... ],       # y-axis values in volts
    };

The C<time> values are simply integers 0 to 255 and represent the 256
samples. They are scaled to units of C<seconds> using
C<time_per_point> and stored in C<time_scaled>. The C<trace> values
are scaled using C<volts_per_point> and stored in C<trace_scaled>. The
original C<trace> values are 8-bit samples (0 .. 255) where 127 is the
0V baseline. Plotting C<time_scaled> values on the x-axis and
C<trace_scaled> on the y-axis will give a nice graph of the frame.

=head1 METHODS

There are no exportable functions or symbols.

The following methods are provided.

=item $pps10 = Device::Velleman::PPS10->new;

Create a new object to read from a single serial port. All parameters
to the constructor are optional.

    port        Serial port to read from. Default: '/dev/ttyS0'.

    verbose     Report actions being taken to STDERR. 0|1. Default: 0.
    debug       Enable dev actions. 0|1. Default: 0.

The returned object is a hash-ref with the following structure:

    $self = {

=item $pps10->read;

=item $pps10->read(<read byte length>);

=item ($length_read, $data_read) = $pps10->read;

Read data from serial port and append to the rasw data buffer in the
object. Returns the length of the read request and the string read in
array context. These are the same values returned by the read() method
of a Device::SerialPort object.

The length of the data to be read is defined by read_bytes value
passed to the constructor. Optional parameter to ->read() overrides
the default read length, for that call of the method. This should not
be necessary since the default value of 255 works well.

=item $pps10->get_next_packet;

Fetches first packet of data from the raw data buffer, parses and
scales it. Returns undef if no complete packet is found in the
buffer. This method should be called repeatedly between each ->read(),
until no packets are returned. See L</"Parsed Packet Data Structure">.

=item $pps10->save_raw_data_to_file('/file/path', [0|1]);

Start saving the raw data read from the serial port to specified
file. Data is written to file with each ->read() after this method is
called. This will essentially save the binary stream from the serial
port to a file. Only one file is opened. If a file is already open for
saving, additional calls to this method are ignored.

If the second parameter is true, the filehandle is unbuffered. This
allows the data to be immediately written to disk after each serial
port read. The filehandle is buffered by default.

Returns 0 if a file is currently open, 1 on success and die()s if
there is an error open()ing the file.

=item $pps10->close_raw_data_file;

Stop saving raw data by closing the data dump file. Does nothing if no
file is open. No return value.

=head1 Misc Notes

BR type packets appear in the stream at 20ms/div and longer. The
parsed packets may not be useful at intervals greater than 20ms/div.

=head1 Bugs

Death, taxes and software bugs. This is the first release of this
module.
